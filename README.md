## Overview

`staking-client-library-ts` is the Typescript SDK for the **Coinbase Staking API** :large_blue_circle:.

The Coinbase Staking API empowers developers to deliver a fully-featured staking experience in their Web2 apps, wallets, or dApps using *one common interface* across protocols.

A traditional infrastructure-heavy staking integration can take months. Coinbase's Staking API enables onboarding within hours :sparkles:.

## Quick Start

Prerequisite: [Node 20+](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node/v/20.11.1)

1. Install this package: `npm install @coinbase/staking-client-library-ts`
2. Create and download an API key from the [Coinbase Developer Platform](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/access/api).
3. Place the key named `.coinbase_cloud_api_key.json` at the root of this repository.
4. Run one of the code samples [below](#stake-partial-eth-ðŸ’ ) or any of our [provided examples](./examples/) :rocket:.

### Stake Partial ETH :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:

This code sample creates an ETH staking workflow. View the full code sample [here](examples/ethereum/create-workflow.ts)

<details open>
  <summary>Code Sample</summary>

```typescript
// examples/ethereum/create-workflow.ts
import { StakingClient } from "@coinbase/staking-client-library-ts";

const client = new StakingClient();

client.Ethereum.stake('holesky', '0xdb816889F2a7362EF242E5a717dfD5B38Ae849FE', '123')
  .then((workflow) => {
    console.log('Workflow created %s', workflow.name);
  })
  .catch(() => {
    throw new Error(`Error creating workflow`);
  });
```

</details>

### View Ethereum Rewards :moneybag:

This code sample returns rewards for an Ethereum validator address. View the full code sample [here](examples/ethereum/list-rewards.ts).

<details open>
  <summary>Code Sample</summary>

```typescript
import { StakingClient } from "@coinbase/staking-client-library-ts";

// Defines which address and rewards we want to see
const address: string =
  '0xac53512c39d0081ca4437c285305eb423f474e6153693c12fbba4a3df78bcaa3422b31d800c5bea71c1b017168a60474';
const filter: string = `address='${address}' AND period_end_time > '2024-02-25T00:00:00Z' AND period_end_time < '2024-02-27T00:00:00Z'`;

const client = new StakingClient();

// Loops through rewards array and prints each reward
client.Ethereum.listRewards(filter).then((resp) => {
  resp.rewards!.forEach((reward) => {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(reward, null, 2));
  });
});
```
